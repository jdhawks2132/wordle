# Wordle Clone

## Deployment

- [Front End Deployed on Vercel](https://wordle-ogtpcsop3-jdhawks2132.vercel.app/)
- [Back End Deployed on Heroku](https://wordsbackend.herokuapp.com/solutions)

## Purpose

The purpose of this project was to explore custom hooks in order to abstract away complex game logic from the React frontend. I also wanted to explore deploying a live application on Vercel - something I had never done before.
